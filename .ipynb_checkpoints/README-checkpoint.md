Business Activities 
Ethereum is working to make online/digital transactions trustable with smart contracts.

Ethereum is defi blockchain with many programs being built on top. Its unfair advantages include being early to market as well as key partnerships with large corporations like Microsoft as well as nations such as Russia. Brand awareness and advanced technical capabilities separate Ethereum from competitors. Currently has the most GitHub contributions, meaning a most people are building on their blockchain. 
The upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 shifted from proof of work to proof of stake, meaning people have to stake their ETH to validate blocks, lowering likelihood of bad actors by aligning interest. The upgrade increased speed and volume of validated transactions.

Landscape

Results 
Ethereum business impact is substantial. The second largest blockchain behind Bitcoin, is making waves to stabilize and increase value proposition. The recent merge to ETH 2.0 has reduced carbon footprint of validating blocks, meaning it utilizes less energy and is faster than previous version. With upgraded capabilities, it has minimized some of the earlier drawbacks raising likelihood of large investments. In turn with additional improvements on the horizon, Ethereum has set it self up to continue it position in the digital economy and grow its reach in the modern economic landscape. 
Some of the key metrics that shape the value of cryptocurrencies are trading volume which ETH is in the top. Along with being the most utilized defi project for dapp building. GitHub data shows that ETH is the top blockchain used to build on through its services. 
With the recent “crypto winter” it has lost some of its market value but has remained stable as one of the spaces top performers and continues to bring solutions to transactions speed lowering gas fees (cost to validate transactions) Along with lower gas fees, there have been advancements in trust ability with switch from proof of work to proof of stake. Meaning people validating transactions must stake their own ETH to confirm blocks. Lowering likely hood of bad actors as if they find a faulty validation, it will cost the bad actor their own investment. Improving the safety of transaction on the Ethereum blockchain.
Ethereum is performing well compared to competitors such as Cardano. Ethereum has a few advantages and areas to improve on. Being first to market is huge advantage, scalability is one area for cause of concern. With many new blockchains comping to market attempting to capitalize on the holes in ETH being a layer 1 technology in which others are built on top of. With the early entry and brand awareness believe they have built up enough social credit to adapt and overcome competitors by addressing what competitors like Cardano and Tezo do and integrating it into their offering. With goal of lowering transaction fees. The biggest advantage Ethereum has is it large developer community and ecosystem.

Recommendations 
Ethereum is doing well with a large developer community. My recommendation would be offering course (which I looked up and they do) on how people with less technical backgrounds can get involved in the community and benefit. We are moving into the digital economy at a rapid pace leaving a people behind. Educational courses with multiple teaching strategies reaching learners at current level, coaching then up to level of competence ensuring brand awareness will continue to separate and widen gap between competitors. For instance, how to set up cold wallets and basic course on how to build apps (dapps) on top of their layer 1 system. Perhaps even like how people used to go to art classes, have NFT course showing people how they can create in the digital world. In turn helping the individual or business modernize.
This strategy would require marketing to the masses, extending its reach beyond current community which does have a great deal of transactions on the chain already into the next stage as a global powerhouse on the level of Coke-a-cola and Nike in terms of brand awareness. Perhaps shrinking the gap in the minds of the masses. Current confusion stem from uncertainty of value proposition, create messaging that simplifies so more minds can comprehend and contribute. 
YouTube channels and podcasts a good start, bankless is one that I go to grow knowledge of Web3 and transition to digital economy. People are no longer locked into legacy media and new methods of delivering information has become simpler for people with internet access. Maybe even having course in the education system to get minds wrapped around how to utilize Ethereum for secure voting and tracking of where taxes are sent. Another learning opportunity may include digital mortgages. Teach real estate industry how to simplify and remove unnecessary steps in the selling of land and homes. Smoother transactions lead to increased peace of mind and more time to enjoy experience of being alive.
